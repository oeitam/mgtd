client_sa.py -> for production
client_direct.py -> client class for testing !!! (def.test_commands) gets the server in the constractor!!
    no tcpip I think
client_script.py -> connects to the server over a socket. supprots testing depending on the config (prod/socker)

server_script.py -> implementaiton of a get-sendback server
server.py -> implementation of server class. server_process is the main method. communicates and sends data to gtd
    class to process.
    Note: when calling the server, we load the defs.py file which initiates the 
        configs etc based on the C:\weekly.local ==> mgtd.local directory

had 3 directories
    production
    demo
    developement
with 3 configs and scripts to switch between them (gotoproduciton.py)
modes
    socket (0)
    direct (1)
    prod (2)
